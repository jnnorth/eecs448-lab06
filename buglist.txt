Bugs List
1. Valgrind finds memory leaks - 118 allocs and 13 frees. This means the destructor most likely doesn't deallocate every node.
2. peekFront() returns element at the back of the queue instead of the front.
3. dequeue() doesn't return the value of the front entry like the documentation says, it returns void.
(This looks like the @return comment was meant to be removed since it's the same @return for peekFront())
4. dequeue() seems to remove the value at the back of the queue, not the front
